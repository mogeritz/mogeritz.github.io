Making stuff is my passion, be it Apps, Furniture, CNC-Machines or [obscure videogame memorabilia](https://metrovideogame.fandom.com/wiki/Lighter). I mostly approach any problem head on, because theres nothing you can't learn by just doing it until it works. Thats the way we learn. Or at least I do.

## Who I am as a Programmer

I can code C#, Java (these are basically the same, fyi), C++, C, and when you put a gun to my head maybe even Javascript. I'm a designer, a dreamer, a maker, but also someone who gets stuff done. 

### Fast and Lean

I am very used to fast prototyping and improvising through many projects I did over the years, and I'm at least decent at it; and if it needs doing, i can also code like that. Granted, it maybe isnt the most vituous way, but beeing comfortable writing hacky, bad, even ugly code, with the knowledge that you are going to improve it later down the line, can help you get where you going much quicker. Trying things, seeing what works and what doesnt, and taking it from there can enable you to work on the important things faster. Sometimes you just need the 'x -> {}' to move on and get to solving the next problem.
